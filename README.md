# Bag Carrier

## Overview

The bag carrier is a low-cost, 3D-printed handheld tool that distributes the weight of bags carried. This 3D Printed Assistive Device can assist people with arthritis or other disabilities to carry plastic bags and reusable bags. The bag handles can easily loop around the two curved hooks. The handle is rounded to allows users to comfortably grip the carrier.
